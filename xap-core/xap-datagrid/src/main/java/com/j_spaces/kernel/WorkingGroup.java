/**
 * This class abstracts a group of cooperating objects that together offer asynchronous message
 * delivery to consumers. A working group is composed of 4 components: A queue of tasks, a
 * worker-thread pool, and a consumer object. When messages (TaskWrapper Objects) are inserted into
 * the WorkingGroup, they are inserted into the queue. The thread pool is responsible of deciding
 * how many worker threads read the messages from the queue, and dispatch them to the consumer
 * object. The consumer object may do anything it pleases with the messages, including forwarding
 * them to another object(s).
