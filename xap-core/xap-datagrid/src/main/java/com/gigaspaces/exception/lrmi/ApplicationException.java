/**
 * An Application Exception abstracts a logical exception rather than an exception in network
 * infrastructure (which is abstracted by RemoteException).
 *
 * When the LRMIRuntime invoked() method is called (on the server side), it tries to invoke the
 * method on the designated object. If the method itself throws an exception, LRMIRuntime
 * encapsulates the exception in an application exception, and throws it back to the protocol
 * adapter. The protocol adapter should transmit the exception to its client peer and throw the
 * exception to the application.
