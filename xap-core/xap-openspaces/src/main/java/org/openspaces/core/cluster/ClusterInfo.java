/**
 * Holds cluster related information. Beans within the Spring context (or processing unit context)
 * can use this bean (by implementing {@link ClusterInfoAware}) in order to be informed of their
 * specific cluster instance deployment.
 *
 * <p> Note, the cluster information is obtained externally from the application context which means
 * that this feature need to be supported by specific containers (and is not supported by plain
 * Spring application context). This means that beans that implement {@link ClusterInfoAware} should
 * take into account the fact that the cluster info provided might be null.
 *
 * <p> Naturally, this information can be used by plain Spring application context by constructing
 * this class using Spring and providing it as a parameter to {@link ClusterInfoBeanPostProcessor}
 * which is also configured within Spring application context. Note, if the same application context
 * will later be deployed into a container that provides cluster information, extra caution need to
 * be taken to resolve clashes. The best solution would be to define the cluster info within a
 * different Spring xml context, and excluding it when deploying the full context to a cluster info
 * aware container.
 *
 * <p> The absence (<code>null</code> value) of a certain cluster information property means that it
 * was not set.
